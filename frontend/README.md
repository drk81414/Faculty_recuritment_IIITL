# FACULTY RECRUITMENT PORTAL

Through this project, we attempt to make a faculty recruitment portal for our college,IIIT Lucknow.

This portal will be well equipped with all the necessary details and terms and conditions. 
It will be made sure that everyone visiting the portal has a smooth experience. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

What makes this faculty recruitment portal unique is the addition of the format for recruitment. By this, we mean whenever thereâ€™s an opening for any of the positions, our website will have a new section for that which will include the written test and the interview details. 
No other college till date has made this addition this except ours.

What is also an addition is the extremely easy to traverse interface.
